## Install

```sh
npm install 
# This will install Dev Dependencies locally based on package.json
```
Some dependencies are required to be able to run the project, to install them run:
```sh
npm install --save @babel/polyfill axios fractional uniqid
```

## Usage (If you want to make any modifications to files)

```sh
npm run start
# This will run webpack-dev-server --mode development --open --watch
# This command will open a new tab on your default web browser and watch for any changes on JS, HTML or SCSS files and reload the page once webpack has done it's job of bundling :D 
```

## This project is powered by an API
Originally the API used to build this project was [food2fork](https://www.food2fork.com/) but this website will close on 30th November 2019, therefore i had to use a part of this API which i found [here](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/), thanks to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).

## How does the application work
Instead of being able to search over 1.000.000 recipes using the Food2fork API, you can now only search with ```pizza```, ```broccoli``` or ```bacon``` words in the app's search bar.

If you type in one of the above three words inside the search bar and hit ```search``` or type ```enter``` on keyboard, the datas from the API will be parsed and be returned in the left part of the app:

</p>

There is 30 results displayed for each of the three recipe type (```pizza```, ```broccoli``` or ```bacon```), 10 results are displayed per page, so a pagination system is displayed on the bottom to be able to show the differents pages:

</p>

Once you click on a recipe on the left, it is then displayed in the middle of the screen like so:

<p align="center">

</p>


Once displayed, you can then update the servings by hovering on ```+``` or ```-```, this will update the ingredients accordingly:

</p>

You can also ```like``` or ```unlike``` recipe(s) by clicking the ```heart button```:

<p align="center">

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/522ie7Y.png" alt="Unliked" width="52" height="50"/>
</p>

The liked recipe(s) will then be displayed in the top right corner of the app by hovering on the ```heart shapped icon```:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pO7EPIf.png" alt="Liked recipe(s)"/>
</p>

Note that liked recipe(s) are made persistent using ```localStorage()``` so once you liked recipe(s) and reload the page, they will still be showed in the "liked recipe(s)" part of the app.

You can also "extract" the ingredients list from a specific recipe and add them to a ```shopping list``` on the right part of the app:

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/e1Msdqb.png" alt="Shopping list"/>
</p>

Then you will be able to add more or less of the added ingredients or simply delete ingredients one by one:

Have fun :D
